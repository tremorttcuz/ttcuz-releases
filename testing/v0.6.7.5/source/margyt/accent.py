"""The accent colour, baked into the places code cannot reach.

Most of TikTok's pink is reachable at runtime: a constant in the bytecode, or a
colour resource read through `Resources.getColor`, both of which the dex patch
sends through the mod. What is not reachable is the pink written into compiled
XML -- a vector's `fillColor`, a selector's item, a shape's solid -- because
the framework parses those itself, inside its own code, where nothing of ours
runs.

Those are settled here instead, while the apk is being built, and both edits
are the size-preserving kind: a colour is eight bytes of Res_value wherever it
appears, so the new one goes exactly where the old one was.

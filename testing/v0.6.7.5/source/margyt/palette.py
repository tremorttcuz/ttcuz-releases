"""Which colours the accent takes over, and what it turns them into.

TikTok is not built around one pink. `#FE2C55` is the one in the brand guide
and the one the bytecode spells out, but the resources hold it at a dozen
opacities and surround it with a family of neighbours -- `#FF1764` fifty times,
`#ED3495` forty-four, and the reds of Shop, LIVE and the gradients behind them.
Repainting only the exact value leaves nine tenths of the red on screen, which
is what the first build did.

So the rule is a zone rather than a value, and the mapping is relative rather
than flat:

* a colour is taken over when its hue is within `HUE` degrees of the reference
  and it is saturated and bright enough to read as part of the family -- grey,
  black and white are near every hue and belong to none;
* it is moved by the same step that takes the reference to the accent, in hue,
  saturation and value, so the reference lands exactly on the accent, a lighter
  member of the family stays lighter, and the two ends of a gradient stay two
  ends of a gradient;
* alpha is never touched.

Only *typed* colours go through here -- entries in the resource table and
attributes in compiled XML, where the format says "this is a colour". An int in
the bytecode is just an int, and widening the rule there would repaint whatever
number happened to look pink.

`inject/java/cat/narezany/margyt/Palette.java` is the same arithmetic in Java,
for the colours that are only known while the app is running. The two have to
agree; `tests/test_margyt.py` pins the cases that say so.

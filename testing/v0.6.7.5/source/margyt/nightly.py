"""Which colours TikTok itself changes when the theme changes.

The obvious place to look is the wrong one. A colour that differs between
light and dark is normally a resource with a `night` variant, and TikTok has
twenty-two of those in the whole apk -- nowhere near a theme. Nor are there
names to go by: the resource names are stripped from this build.

The theme is in the styles. Every colour in TikTok's design system is a theme
attribute, and the two themes are two styles that give the same attribute two
different values -- `#FF121212` against `#FFFFFFFF`, `#1AFFFFFF` against
`#1A161823`. An attribute that holds exactly one colour is not part of the
switch; an attribute that holds two is, and both of those values are colours
the app repaints when the theme changes.

So this reads the style table and collects those values. That set, and nothing
else, is what the mod's theming is allowed to touch -- which is the whole of
the rule: repaint a colour only where TikTok would have repainted it.

What each value becomes is decided while the app runs, not here: the mod knows
which theme is on, and a colour's distance from that theme's own background is
the distance it keeps from the chosen one.

    Two lists, because knowing a colour belongs to the theme is not the same as
    knowing that *this* use of it is the theme's. `#FFFFFFFF` is the dark
    theme's text and it is also the white of an icon over a video and the white
    of a photo's background; `#FF1B1B1B` is a card and is nothing else in the
    whole apk.

    So a colour that appears nowhere except in a theme token is repainted
    wherever it turns up. One that is used elsewhere as an ordinary colour is
    repainted only where it arrives *as* a theme colour -- read from a theme
    attribute or a colour resource -- and left alone when some drawing code
    simply asked for white.

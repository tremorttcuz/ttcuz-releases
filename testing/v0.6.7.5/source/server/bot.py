"""The MargyT bot.

Two things: whose TikTok profile is this -- the name, the picture and the
badges -- and here is an icon I drew.

It talks to Telegram by long polling rather than a webhook, which needs no
certificate and no port open -- the bot asks Telegram for what happened and
Telegram answers when something has. On a box that is already serving badges
over plain http, that is one less thing to get wrong.

The token lives in `bot.txt` beside the database, written by hand, never here.

On looking up a TikTok account by its @name: there is no API for that, so the
profile page is read and the id taken out of the blob the page carries for its
own use. That works today and is nobody's promise -- when it stops, the bot
says it cannot find them rather than pretending.

/**
 * What a MargyT plugin extends.
 *
 * Everything here does nothing by default, so a plugin overrides the one or two
 * hooks it cares about and ignores the rest. New hooks can be added to this
 * class without breaking a plugin that was written before they existed, which
 * is the whole reason it is a class rather than an interface.
 *
 * A plugin's code is loaded into TikTok's own process, with this mod's classes
 * as its parent, so it can call anything in `cat.narezany.margyt` and anything
 * the app itself can reach. There is no sandbox and there cannot be one: read
 * what you install.
 *
 * Every hook is called with whatever thread the app happens to be on -- the
 * activity ones on the main thread, `onStart` before the application's own
 * onCreate. Anything slow belongs on a thread of the plugin's own. A hook that
 * throws is caught, written to the diary and never called again in that
 * process; it does not take TikTok down.
 *
 * See docs/plugins.md.

/**
 * TikTok's accent colour, made changeable.
 *
 * The app is built around one pink, `#FE2C55`: the like, the follow button, the
 * tab underline, the badges. Most of the places it is drawn hold it as a plain
 * constant in the bytecode -- `const v1, -0x1d3ab` before a `Paint.setColor` --
 * so the build rewrites each of those into a call here, and the colour becomes
 * whatever this returns.
 *
 * This sits in the drawing path of half the app, so it answers from a cached
 * int and never throws: the worst it can do when something is wrong is hand
 * back the pink the app came with.

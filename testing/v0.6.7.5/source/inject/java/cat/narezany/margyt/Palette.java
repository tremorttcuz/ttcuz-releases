/**
 * Which colours the accent takes over, and what it turns them into.
 *
 * The same arithmetic as `margyt/palette.py`, which does this to the resource
 * table and the compiled XML while the apk is built. This one is for the
 * colours that are only known while the app is running -- whatever comes back
 * from `Resources.getColor`, from a `TypedArray`, or out of a constant the
 * bytecode patch redirected here.
 *
 * The two have to agree: a build bakes the resources with the python and the
 * app moves the rest with this, and a colour that came out mint in one and
 * something else in the other would show as a seam down the middle of a screen.
 *
 * TikTok is not built around a single pink. `#FE2C55` is the one in the brand
 * guide, but the app draws it at a dozen opacities and surrounds it with a
 * family -- the magentas of the gradients, the reds of Shop and LIVE. So the
 * rule is a zone around the reference hue, and the move is relative: whatever
 * step takes the reference to the accent is applied to every member, so the
 * reference lands exactly on the accent and a lighter member stays lighter.
 * Alpha is never touched.

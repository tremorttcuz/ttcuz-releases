/**
 * Saving a video without the stamp burned into it.
 *
 * TikTok's own model carries two addresses for the same video:
 *
 *     Video.getDownloadAddr()             -- the one the save button uses
 *     Video.getDownloadNoWatermarkAddr()  -- the one beside it, unstamped
 *
 * Both are real, unobfuscated names, both return the same type, and the second
 * is TikTok's, not ours: the app already models it, for the cases where it
 * serves the file clean itself. So the swap is a rewrite of the call site --
 * the same 35c instruction, the same register count, the same return type --
 * rather than anything that has to understand the download.
 *
 * It is off by default and it falls back on itself: when the switch is off, or
 * when the unstamped address is missing for this post, what comes back is
 * exactly what TikTok asked for. A post whose clean address the server did not
 * send still saves, stamped, instead of failing to save at all.

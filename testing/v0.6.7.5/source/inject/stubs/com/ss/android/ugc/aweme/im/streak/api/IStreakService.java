/**
 * TikTok's own streak service, in outline.
 *
 * The name of the interface is real and so are the signatures; the three
 * method names are not, and they are this release's. They are written here
 * because a call rewritten into the mod has to be handed back with the same
 * types the verifier saw, and that needs a declaration to compile against.
 *
 * Nothing else in the mod names them. The rules in `dexpatch` are the only
 * other place, and the build reports how many call sites each one matched, so
 * a release that renames them shows up as a zero rather than as silence.
